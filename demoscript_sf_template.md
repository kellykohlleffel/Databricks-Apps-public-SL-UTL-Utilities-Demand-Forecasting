### Introduction (3 minutes)

**[Slide: DemandPredict AI Utilities Overview]**

"Thank you all for joining today. I'm [Name] from Fivetran, and I'm excited to show you a prototype solution that demonstrates how AI-driven approaches could potentially transform utilities demand forecasting and energy management strategies. As utility leaders, you understand the mounting pressure from increasing energy demand variability, aging grid infrastructure, and the need to optimize resource allocation while maintaining grid reliability.

Today's utility organizations are facing unprecedented challenges:

- 75% of utilities struggle with demand forecasting accuracy during peak periods
- 68% of organizations spend excessive resources on manual energy consumption analysis
- Grid operators analyzing hundreds of smart meter readings consuming 4+ hours daily
- Difficulty predicting peak demand patterns across diverse weather conditions
- Challenges optimizing energy distribution across multiple service territories

Industry research indicates:

- Utility teams struggle to integrate smart meter data, weather analytics, and customer behavior into actionable demand insights
- Energy demand optimization often lacks real-time predictive capabilities
- Peak demand management remains highly reactive rather than proactive
- Legacy grid management tools struggle with dynamic load forecasting optimization

DemandPredict AI is a prototype that demonstrates how bringing together data from smart meter platforms, weather forecasting services, and customer information systems – integrated through Fivetran – and applying AI Agent Workflows could potentially automate demand forecasting insights and optimize grid operations.

In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you this proof-of-concept and discuss how such an approach might help address challenges in reducing energy waste, improving demand prediction accuracy, and optimizing peak load management."

### Business Challenge Context (2 minutes)

**[Slide: The Utilities Demand Forecasting Challenge]**

"The challenge most utility organizations face isn't a lack of data – it's that critical energy intelligence is often trapped in disconnected systems:

- Smart meter data in platforms like Itron, Sensus, and Landis+Gyr
- Weather forecasting insights in systems like The Weather Company, AccuWeather, and DTN
- Customer information in systems like Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing, SAP IS-U, and Siebel CRM
- Grid management data in platforms like Schneider Electric EcoStruxure, GE Digital Grid Solutions, and ABB Ability
- Energy trading information in systems like ERCOT, PJM Interconnection, and ISO New England
- Advanced metering infrastructure from Honeywell Elster, Aclara Technologies, and Kamstrup

When weather patterns shift or customer energy consumption changes, the correlation between these data sources may not be immediately obvious without connecting all these pieces. Demand management teams often lack the time to manually analyze this data across thousands of meters and multiple service territories.

DemandPredict AI demonstrates how automatically integrating data from these sources through Fivetran's utilities connectors and applying AI Agent Workflows could potentially reveal actionable insights that teams might use for both demand prediction and grid optimization."
